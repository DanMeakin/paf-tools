Postcode Address File Tools
===========================

Python tools for interacting with the data provided by the UK Royal Mail in 
their Postcode Address File.

Before using this, you will need to purchase a licence for the PAF (or 
qualify for an exemption from the price of a licence).

PAF Mainfile
------------

In the UK, the Royal Mail has ownership of the database containing every 
address and postcode. They provide this to individuals and businesses who
pay for a licence for the data.

It is provided in a number of formats, the standard format being the 
"Mainfile" database. This is a series of text files containing various 
types of data which comprise UK addresses.

Due to the way it is structured, a lot of data has to be parsed and stored or 
represented in a more sensible way than it appears in the PAF. This project 
provides some tools to extract the data from the PAF and to construct an SQL
database from it.

Tools
-----

The aim is to provide all of the following tools to aid users wishing to 
access the PAF data:-

* PAF parser;
* Database constructor; and
* A lookup API.

I may have more ideas which I want to add later. I welcome any suggestions 
for other tools and features to add.
